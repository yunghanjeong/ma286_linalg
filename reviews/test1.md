## Chapter 1. System of Linear Equations

Recall univariate linear equation: $\ y = mx + b $

![slopegraphlabel2](https://github.com/yunghanjeong/mat286_linalg/assets/11448807/ead1c659-f829-4571-9eae-9db6a4607a01)

which can also be written as: $\ a_1x + a_2y = b $

similarly: $\ a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 = b $

thus a linear equation with n variables can be written as

$\ a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + ... + a_nx_n = b $

#### Definitions
$\ a_1, a_2,... a_n$ are known as **coefficients** and consist of real numbers

$\ b$ is a costant, a real number

$\ x_1, x_2,... x_n$ are known as **variables**

$\ a_1, x_1$ are known as **leading** coeffeicient and variables, respectively

### System of Linear Equations

A system of linear equations or a linear system of m equations and n varible is represented as:

$$\\begin{matrix}
a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + ... + a_{1n}x_n = b_1\\
a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + ... + a_{2n}x_n = b_2\\
...\\
a_{m1}x_1 + a_{m2}x_2 + ... + a_{mn}x_n = b_m\\
\end{matrix}$$

This can be matricized 

$$\\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11}, a_{12}, ... a_{1n}\\
a_{21}, a_{22}, ... a_{2n}\\
...\\
a_{m1}, a_{m2}, ... a_{mn}\\
\end{bmatrix}$$
